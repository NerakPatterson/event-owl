I created my page with an aside section that links to the events. I have the upcoming events link to the events page. 
The hover color is applied to links inluding in the nav bar.
I have 6 event's in which I used the grid approach over the flexbox to categorize my events.
I included a footer with the copyright in the footer of each page.
My food and price table has the food options and orices. It also, hovers green in the column to see those options in that category.
On the locations page I used placeholder images since I have 2 different venue locations as well as work hours.
The contact form has a basic input field with name and email and a message box for inquiries.
